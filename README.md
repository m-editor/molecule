> Independent native editor

## ❓ What is molecule?
Molecule is an independent native text editor.

## 💻 Why not VSCode?
VSCode is without a doubt a very good editor, unfortunately it has one major drawback. Electron. Electron is a ramhog, so VSCode already gets a very high RAM load with little work.

## 🧩 Plugin Support
Plugin support for Molecule is planned. However, the focus is currently on other things.

## 🖌️ Theme Support
Like plugin support, user theme support is also planned and will be implemented very soon.

## 🐧 Why are there only binaries for Linux?
I only use Linux as my operating system. The other platforms like MacOS or Windows do not interest me. But everyone is free to compile the code for these platforms.
